## Practical 6: Rectangle Class
Problem Statement:
Define a Java class named Rectangle with width and height as data members. Provide a no-argument constructor and a parameterized constructor. Implement methods to calculate and return the area and perimeter.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter side a: 11
Enter side b: 11
Enter side c: 11
Triangle Area: 52.39453692895854
Triangle Perimeter: 33.0
```

## Practical 7: Employee Class
Problem Statement:
Create an Employee class with private data members for employee name and salary. Implement methods to read employee data from the user and display the employee details. Demonstrate object creation and method invocation.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter employee name: ved
Enter employee salary: 100000
Employee Name: ved
Employee Salary: 100000.0
```

## Practical 8: Point Class
Problem Statement:
Create a Point class representing a two-dimensional point. Implement a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a copy constructor. Include a method to display the point coordinates.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Default constructor -> Point coordinates: (5, 5)
Enter x coordinate: 1 4
Enter y coordinate: Parameterized constructor -> Point coordinates: (1, 4)
Copy constructor -> Point coordinates: (1, 4)
```

## Practical 9: Rectangle Comparison
Problem Statement:
Create two Rectangle objects with predefined dimensions. Display their width, height, area, and perimeter. Compare the areas of both rectangles and display which one has the larger area.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter details for first rectangle:
Width: 10
Height: 11

Enter details for second rectangle:
Width: 11
Height: 10

First Rectangle:
Width: 10.0
Height: 11.0
Area: 110.0
Perimeter: 42.0

Second Rectangle:
Width: 11.0
Height: 10.0
Area: 110.0
Perimeter: 42.0

Both rectangles have the same area.
```
