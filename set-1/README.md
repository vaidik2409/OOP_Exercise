# SET-1 (Basics of JAVA)

## Compilation Guide
To compile all java files in this set, run:
```bash
javac *.java
```

## Practical 1: Distance Converter
Problem Statement:
Develop a Java program that prompts the user to enter a distance in meters. The program should convert the distance into feet using the conversion factor (1 meter = 3.28084 feet) and display the result formatted to two decimal places.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter distance in meters: 100
Distance in feet : 328.08
```

## Practical 2: Cramer's Rule (Linear Equations)
Problem Statement:
Write a Java program to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables using Cramer's Rule. The program should accept coefficients from the user, calculate the determinant, and compute the values of x and y. Include proper handling when the determinant is zero.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Solve system of linear equations:
Equation 1: a*x + b*y = e
Equation 2: c*x + d*y = f
Enter coefficient a: 1
Enter coefficient b: 2
Enter coefficient c: 3
Enter coefficient d: 4
Enter constant e: 5
Enter constant f: 6
Solution:
x = -4.00
y = 4.50
```

## Practical 3: Vowel Checker
Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a single character and determines whether it is a vowel or a consonant. The program should work for both uppercase and lowercase letters.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter a single letter: E
The letter 'e' is a vowel.
Enter a single letter: k
The letter 'k' is a consonant.
```

## Practical 4: BMI Calculator
Problem Statement:
Develop a Java application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI). The program should accept weight in pounds and height in inches, convert them into kilograms and meters respectively, and calculate the BMI value.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter your weight in pounds: 154
Enter your height in inches: 70
Your BMI is: 22.10
Category: Normal weight
```

## Practical 5: Area of Triangle
Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle as input. Validate whether the sides can form a triangle and calculate the area using Heron's formula.

**Sample Output:**
```text
Enter length of side a: 3
Enter length of side b: 4
Enter length of side c: 5
The area of the triangle is: 6.00
```
